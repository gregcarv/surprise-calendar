# Casestudy Front-end Developer

NLO organizes a new promotional game.

- A website needs to be developed where visitors see a huge surprise calendar with 10000 scratchable areas.
- In one area there is the main prize of 25000 euros.
- There are 100 consolation prizes hidden.
- A visitor of the website can only scratch open one area.
- They can see which squares have already been opened by other users.

In the programming language and framework of your choice:

- Create a web page that holds the surprise calendar. It does not need to have any styling. It can be
  an unstyled grid of 100x100 squares.
- A user can scratch away the surface of one and only one area, slowly revealing the prize
  underneath.
- When reloading the page, state must be preserved
- There is no need to build an authentication mechanis, so you can simply simulate multiple users
  scratching.
