# Casestudy Front-end Developer

NLO organizes a new promotional game.

- A website needs to be developed where visitors see a huge surprise calendar with 10000 scratchable areas.
- In one area there is the main prize of 25000 euros.
- There are 100 consolation prizes hidden.
- A visitor of the website can only scratch open one area.
- They can see which squares have already been opened by other users.

In the programming language and framework of your choice:

- Create a web page that holds the surprise calendar. It does not need to have any styling. It can be
  an unstyled grid of 100x100 squares.
- A user can scratch away the surface of one and only one area, slowly revealing the prize
  underneath.
- When reloading the page, state must be preserved
- There is no need to build an authentication mechanis, so you can simply simulate multiple users
  scratching.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
